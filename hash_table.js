// Hashing is a common technique for storing data in such a way that the data can be inserted and retrieved very qui
// quickly.

// Hashing uses a data stuctrue called a hash table.
// Hash tables perform poorly for operations that involve searching, like searching for minimum or max values in a data set.


// The hash table data structure is designed around an array. The array consists of elements 0 through some pre-determined size, though the size can be increased when necessary.
// Each data element is stored in the array based on an associated data element called the key. To store a piece of data in a hash table, the key is mapped into a number in the range of 0 through the hash table size, using a
// hash function.
